In the summer of 2023 I participated in the filming of a short programme intended for the  **L'Esprit Sorcier** science communication programme. The segment filmed presented a step-by-step process for preparing and studying microbial fuel cell systems and is designed to inspire children and young adults to take an interest in a career in science. The programme was released on French television and online in February 2024 and can be viewed here: https://youtu.be/MfGH3_HogLU?t=4333
