“Tailored Carbon Nanomaterial Interfaces for Electrocatalysis, Electroanalysis and Microbial Fuel Cell Applications” European Materials Research Society (EMRS) Spring Meeting 2022

I was delighted to present our work at EMRS for the first time post-pandemic. The symposium was replete with very interesting presentations on carbon nanomaterials and our small section on biological applications generated a lot of discussion despite being the afternoon session towards the end of the programme. I came away feeling up to date on nanocarbons and energised to try all sorts of new experiments in the lab - exactly what you want from a world class international conference!
