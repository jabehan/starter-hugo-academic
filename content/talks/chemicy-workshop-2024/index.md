I was invited to give a talk on the use of the **Differential Centrifugal Sedimentation** technique for nanoparticle sizing at the **CHEMICY Workshop** at the Ecole Nationale Superieur de Rennes on the **27/11/2024**. 

Great discussions were had in the follow up with colleagues in diverse areas from ice chemistry to geology. I am hoping to introduce this technique to a lot of colleagues in the coming months - stay tuned!
