The team at [the Colavita Group, Trinity College Dublin](https://sites.google.com/site/colavitagroup/) have just published their latest article in Small, entitled **[Single-Entity Electrochemistry of N-Doped Graphene Oxide Nanostructures for Improved Kinetics of Vanadyl Oxidation](https://doi.org/10.1002/smll.202405220)**

I am very happy to be a co-author on this excellent work and look forward to further collaboration together on future articles!
