I﻿ am delighted to share our latest article in Bioelectrochemistry, entitled **[Fe(III) oxide microparticles modulate extracellular electron transfer in anodic biofilms dominated by bacteria of the Pelobacter genus](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1567539423000312)**

O﻿k, so the title is a mouthful, but what we showed was a very interesting behaviour of a biofilm in the presence and absence of alternative electron acceptors to the anode. This behaviour was rapidly reversible and could be controlled simply by coating the bioanodes with a layer of iron oxide microparticles, or gently rinsing those particles off.

I﻿t is my first article at Université de Rennes as corresponding author!
