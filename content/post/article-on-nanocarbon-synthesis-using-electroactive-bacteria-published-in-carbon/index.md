Our article on the sustainable production of nanocarbons from fluorographite materials was recently published in <a href="https://doi-org/10.1016/j.carbon.2025.121053">Carbon</a>.

This paper represents the first route - to my knowledge - from a fluorocarbon precursor to graphene oxides and graphene quantum dot materials using only aqueous conditions, at low temperature and neutral pH.

We achieve this through the unique behaviour of electroactive bacteria to transfer electrons extracellularly, breaking the C-F bond in these structures and producing nanocarbon materials with controlled size and tuneable surface chemistry.

We have a lot of follow-up studies planned based on this initial article.

Attached is a digital cover graphically illustrating the bioexfoliation of fluorographite, prepared by Jean-François Bergamini.
