We were delighted to welcome Prof. Paula Colavita to the lab at the ISCR, to give a talk on her lab's many fascinating projects on carbon nanomaterial characterisation.

Paula also participated at Carbon 2025 in Saint Malo - just a short train trip away from Rennes.

It is hard to believe it is more than a decade since I started my PhD in Paula's lab at Trinity College Dublin. But it is a great feeling to continue collaborating, exchanging and working together after all of this time.

Thanks for the visit Paula and we will visit you in Dublin again soon for sure!
