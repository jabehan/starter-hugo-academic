# My First Microbial Fuel Cell!

So, you want to set up your first microbial fuel cell, but you have no idea where to start? That makes two of us - or at least it would, if you were talking to me from 2 months ago. I have a [fair amount of experience ](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=tae1A2AAAAAJ&hl=en)in fundamental electrochemistry, but it was only upon starting my fellowship as a Marie Skłodowska Curie at the Université de Rennes 1 that I actually got around to assembling an actual fuel cell. This short blog will serve as a quick guide on how to go about this. I'm not claiming that this method is perfect (feel free to chip in with improved tips or suggestions if you are reading this as an expert) but it should be enough to get started. Also, while my focus is on microbial fuel cells, the basic assembly described here should also be suitable for a variety of similar devices.

## A Preview of What We Will be Making

Below is a preview of the end product - a fully assembled 'H type' fuel cell. The anode and cathode compartments are separated by a proton exchange membrane in the centre.

## Glassware

Probably the most important part of the whole process is deciding on the type of glassware you are going to use. Above is a photo of one half of the H cell, which is formed based on a 250 mL borosilicate glass bottle. After a trip to the local glassblower, 3 ports were added to the bottle in addition to the bridge at the bottom for the H-cell assembly. I wanted 3 ports to have one space reserved for a reference electrode, one space reserved for introducing inert gas, and one final port to use for pumping out the cell contents. Looking back now, it might have been preferable to have this 3rd port placed lower on the glass bottle for ease of pumping - try to think about what your particular application will need (pH meter? thermometer? microelectrode probe?...) and come up with a design that suits.
