# My First Microbial Fuel Cell!

So, you want to set up your first microbial fuel cell, but you have no idea where to start? That makes two of us - or at least it would, if you were talking to me from 2 months ago. I have a [fair amount of experience ](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=tae1A2AAAAAJ&hl=en)in fundamental electrochemistry, but it was only upon starting my fellowship as a Marie Skłodowska Curie at the Université de Rennes 1 that I actually got around to assembling an actual fuel cell. This short blog will serve as a quick guide on how to go about this. I'm not claiming that this method is perfect (feel free to chip in with improved tips or suggestions if you are reading this as an expert) but it should be enough to get started.
