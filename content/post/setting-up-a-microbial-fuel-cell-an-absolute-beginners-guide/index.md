# My First Microbial Fuel Cell!

So, you want to set up your first microbial fuel cell, but you have no idea where to start? That makes two of us - or at least it would, if you were talking to me from 2 months ago. I have a [fair amount of experience ](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=tae1A2AAAAAJ&hl=en)in fundamental electrochemistry, but it was only upon starting my fellowship as a Marie Skłodowska Curie at the Université de Rennes 1 that I actually got around to assembling an actual fuel cell. This short blog will serve as a quick guide on how to go about this. I'm not claiming that this method is perfect (feel free to chip in with improved tips or suggestions if you are reading this as an expert) but it should be enough to get started. Also, while my focus is on microbial fuel cells, the basic assembly described here should also be suitable for a variety of similar devices.

## A Preview of What We Will be Making

Below is a preview of the end product - a fully assembled 'H type' fuel cell. The anode and cathode compartments are separated by a proton exchange membrane in the centre.

## Glassware

Probably the most important part of the whole process is deciding on the type of glassware you are going to use. Above is a photo of one half of the H cell, which is formed based on a 250 mL borosilicate glass bottle. After a trip to the local glassblower, 3 ports were added to the bottle in addition to the bridge at the bottom for the H-cell assembly. I wanted 3 ports to have one space reserved for a reference electrode, one space reserved for introducing inert gas, and one final port to use for pumping out the cell contents. Looking back now, it might have been preferable to have this 3rd port placed lower on the glass bottle for ease of pumping - try to think about what your particular application will need (pH meter? thermometer? microelectrode probe?...) and come up with a design that suits. 

## Joining the Glassware

I don't know the proper name for the above piece of kit that 'joins' the 2 cells together, but it is essentially like the blue twist caps pictured on the bottles, except with 2 sides and a hole in the centre. The idea is to simply twist both cells on to this 'joiner' via the lower port, forming the 'H-cell' shape. In our lab, we have also had some success with an alternative design which uses a flat cylindrical glass port on each bottle and a clamp to hold the cells together. I will focus on the screw cap design in this post, though, as I am more aware of its pitfalls!

Before using the joiner, inspect the interior threads for any debris or defects. In particular if you are re-using an old joiner, rinse it well with millipore water (or at least distilled water) to remove any lingering salts remaining from buffer solutions. Anything blocking the threads will make it difficult to screw the glassware together and will cause headaches later.

In order to use the 'double screw' connection type, you will need to form a seal between the glass bottles and the proton exchange membrane, so that the solution inside does not leak out of the fuel cell or cross over from one side to the other. We accomplish this using the O-ring pictured below, but you can also try with a more typical black vycor o-ring of the same diameter.

## Screw it on Straight!

Start by screwing the joiner on to the port of one of the glass bottles. Take care to ensure that it is screwed on perfectly straight - with these screw assemblies, it is very easy to 'tighten' them without properly orienting the glass threads into the corresponding grooves on the cap. If that happens you are liable to either have a leaking fuel cell, or to break the glass assembly when trying to tighten it due to misalignment.

Once you have screwed on the joiner, check that you can easily insert the o ring in the middle. It should fit snugly inside the joiner on top of the glass, as pictured above. If there are any noticeable gaps or evidence of a poor seal (e.g. if you are re-using an old o-ring or joiner) *save yourself time later by replacing them now.* If the cell doesn't seal properly, you will have to disassemble everything later anyway.

## The Membrane

Below is an example of a proton exchange membrane that we use in our H-cells. We also have transparent Nafion membranes, which seem to be more common in the literature, but for illustration purposes I will stick with this one as it is easier to photograph!

![](20220304_090544-small-.jpg)

I recommend using the outer diameter of the o-ring as a template for cutting out the membrane. Try to cut out a circle which is slightly larger than this diameter, and then trim the edges.

![](20220304_092105-small-.jpg)

You can see in the below image that the circle is not perfect - in particular there is a jagged corner on the bottom that must be trimmed off with the scissors.

![](20220304_090823-small-.jpg)

After you cut the membrane to size, insert it into the joiner on top of the o-ring. It should look like the photo below. If you have difficulty getting the membrane to stay flush with the o-ring, you need to trim the edges a little more. In particular if the membrane is 'bending' against the sides of the joiner, you won't get a good seal in the final assembly and it will more than likely leak. Trim the edges until it fits comfortably. Don't trim them too much, however, as this will leave enough space for a leak across the cells (and compromise your experiment). It is OK if you can see part of the o-ring beneath the membrane (as I can in the bottom right of the joiner in the photo below) but any more than this will result in a leak, at least in my experience.
