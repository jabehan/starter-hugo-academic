Camille Scola recently began her PhD in the team on our CNRS-funded 80Prime project BauxCLEAN.

Camille is joint-supervised with Géosciences Rennes by Dr. Mathieu Martinez (right in the photo) along with myself and Frédéric Barrière - the man behind the camera in the photo.

As shown in the photo, Camille was enthusiastic to go on the initial field survey to Bédarieux to collect some real bauxite samples. That survey has been completed, giving us dozens of samples to work on over the course of the 3-year research project.

Welcome Camille! Her pages on the Géosciences Rennes page and ISCR page can be found here: https://geosciences.univ-rennes.fr/actualites/camille-scola-doctorante-iscr-dans-lequipe-paleoenvironnement
