O﻿ur article entitled '**Quartz Crystal Microbalance Method to Measure Nanoparticle–Receptor Interactions and Evaluate Nanoparticle Design Efficiency**' was finally published in *JACS Au.* Huge congratulations to everyone involved! You can see the article linked below, and also take a look at the cover art which I produced and designed using Blender to illustrate the concept of a quartz crystal microbalance allowing us to probe bionanoparticle-receptor interactions at the nanoscale.
