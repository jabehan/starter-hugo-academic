We are happy to welcome three master's students in the team.

*Baptiste Cibron* and *Matthieu Laville* join us for their Master 1 projects. Both will study the interactions of electroactive bacteria with nanomaterials, with different focuses on human health or material synthesis aspects.

*Kader Zerbo* will carry out his Master 2 project as part of the *IRIS-E - Interdisciplinary Research & Innovative Solutions for Environmental transition* programme financed by the Universit√© de Rennes. He will investigate the application of electroactive bacteria in the treatment and valorisation of mine waste.

A huge welcome to the students!
