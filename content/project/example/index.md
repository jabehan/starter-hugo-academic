Fuel cells are devices which exploit redox processes as power sources.
State-of-the-art H2/O2 fuel cells employ precious metal catalysts such
as Pt and other Pt-group metals, presenting issues of cost and
sustainability. There is therefore a significant interest in exploring nonprecious
transition metals (e.g. Fe, Co, Mn) as catalysts in particular for
the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), the current ‘bottle-neck’ in
improved fuel cell catalyst performance. Certain bacterial cultures are
known to form biofilms with a high tolerance to these aforementioned
metals through evolved mechanisms for neutralising the toxic effects
of heavy metal ions, such as membrane complex formation and
intracellular precipitation of the metal ions as nanoparticles. In this
project, I aim to exploit this natural metal tolerance to employ
bacterial biofilms as *living factories* for the preparation of biogenic
non-Pt metal electrocatalysts. I will prepare biofilm-modified
carbon electrodes by immersing surface-modified carbon
electrode materials in solutions containing controlled amounts of
chosen metal ions (e.g. Mn, Co and other heavy metals with potential
electrocatalytic activity). After optimising the metal sequestering
properties of these biofilms, I will subject the resulting modified
electrodes to thermal annealing treatments to form high-activity
carbon-supported transition metal electrocatalysts and evaluate their
performance as novel, biologically-derived catalysts for ORR
