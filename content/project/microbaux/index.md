The extraction of aluminium from Bauxite requires a separation from other undesirable components such as iron by acid leaching and high temperature annealing, which leaves a non-exploited ‘red mud’ with both economic and environmental implications. 

We propose here a method to extract the iron from the aluminium in a bauxite rock using the natural metabolic processes of electroactive bacteria. In previous publications, our consortium shows that when these bacteria, for instance those of the Geobacter genus, efficiently reduce iron from Fe(III) to Fe(II) under ambient conditions.

This project gathers the cross—discipline expertise from chemists at the **[https://iscr.univ-rennes.fr/](Institut des Sciences Chimiques de Rennes)** and **[https://geosciences.univ-rennes.fr/](Géosciences Rennes)** bioelectrochemistry experts and geologists to characterize and quantify the changes in the mineral phases before and after the biological treatment.
