Following on from the MicroBaux project, we were privileged to obtain financing for a 3-year doctoral fellowship to continue this exciting research! This project, entitled BauxCLEAN, will expand the preliminary studies of MicroBAUX.

We have already recruited a motivated and hard-working PhD student, <a href="https://www.behanlab.com/post/welcoming-new-phd-student-camille-scola/">Camille Scola</a>, who started with us in October 2025.
