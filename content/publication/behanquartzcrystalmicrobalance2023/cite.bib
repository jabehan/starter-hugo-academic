    abstract = {Conjugation of biomolecules on the surface of nanoparticles (NPs) to achieve active targeting is widely investigated within the scientific community. However, while a basic framework of the physicochemical processes underpinning bionanoparticle recognition is now emerging, the precise evaluation of the interactions between engineered NPs and biological targets remains underdeveloped. Here, we show how the adaptation of a method currently used to evaluate molecular ligand–receptor interactions by quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) can be used to obtain concrete insights into interactions between different NP architectures and assemblies of receptors. Using a model bionanoparticle grafted with oriented apolipoprotein E (ApoE) fragments, we examine key aspects of bionanoparticle engineering for effective interactions with target receptors. We show that the QCM technique can be used to rapidly measure construct–receptor interactions across biologically relevant exchange times. We contrast random adsorption of the ligand at the surface of the NPs, resulting in no measurable interaction with target receptors, to grafted oriented constructs, which are strongly recognized even at lower graft densities. The effects of other basic parameters impacting the interaction such as ligand graft density, receptor immobilization density, and linker length were also efficiently evaluated with this technique. Dramatic changes in interaction outcomes with subtle alterations in these parameters highlight the general importance of measuring the interactions between engineered NPs and target receptors ex situ early on in the construct development process for the rational design of bionanoparticles.},
