abstract: "Polypyrrole films are commonly prepared as conductive electrode surfaces for a variety of applications. Recently, there has been increasing interest in improving the adhesive properties and biocompatibility of polypyrrole electrodes via the incorporation of bioinspired polydopamine within the polymer scaffold. However, very little is currently known about the structural effects of polydopamine incorporation during the electropolymerisation of hybrid films. In this work, we combine electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance studies, fundamental electrochemical characterisation, atomic force microscopy, and a suite of spectroscopic techniques in order to correlate changes in the structure and performance of polypyrrole–polydopamine films to the structural modifications of the nanostructure induced by polydopamine incorporation. The results indicate that polydopamine incorporation greatly increases the rate of hybrid film deposition, as well as improving adhesion, surface homogeneity, and wettability, with no compromise in charge transfer properties. Polydopamine incorporation is strongly suggested to occur in non-connected domains within a predominantly polypyrrole-like scaffold. We propose a two-step model of co-polymerisation and the subsequent surface adhesion of hybrid films. Results are expected to be of broad general interest to researchers utilizing polypyrrole and polydopamine to prepare tailor-made electrodes for biosensing and catalysis."
