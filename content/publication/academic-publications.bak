  abstract = {The effect of glycan adlayers on the electrochemical response of glassy carbon electrodes was studied using standard redox probes and complex aqueous matrices. Aryldiazonium cations of aryl-lactoside precursors were used to modify glassy carbon via spontaneous and electrochemically assisted covalent grafting. Contact angle and fluorescence binding using Peanut Agglutinin (PNA) as a diagnostic lectin indicate that electrografting results in adlayers with greater glycan surface density than those obtained via spontaneous reaction. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy with a fluorinated analog confirmed that electrografting results in multilayers of cross-linked aryl-lactosides. Adsorption studies with Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) show that aryl-lactoside adlayers minimize unspecific protein adsorption. However, no significant differences were detected between spontaneous and electrografted layers in their ability to resist protein fouling despite their differences in coverage. Voltammetry studies show that spontaneous grafting has minimal effects on the response of standard redox probes in solution, whereas electrografting results in additional charge transfer impedance arising from increased electrode passivation. Bare and lactoside-modified carbon electrodes were tested for the detection of caffeine before and after prolonged exposure to coffee solutions. Spontaneous grafting was found to result in optimal properties by imparting antifouling performance in these complex matrices while preserving fast interfacial charge transfer.},

  abstract = {Metal-free nitrogenated amorphous carbon electrodes were synthesised via dc plasma magnetron sputtering and post-deposition annealing at different temperatures. The electrocatalytic activity of the electrodes towards the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) was studied as a function of pH using cyclic voltammetry with a rotating disk electrode. The trends in onset potential were correlated to the carbon nanostructure and chemical composition of the electrodes as determined via Raman spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis. Results suggest that: 1) the ORR activity in acidic conditions is strongly correlated to the concentration of pyridinic nitrogen sites. 2) At high pH, the presence of graphitic nitrogen sites and a graphitized carbon scaffold are the strongest predictors of high ORR onsets, while pyridinic nitrogen site density does not correlate to ORR activity. An inversion region where pyridine-mediated activity competes with graphitic-N mediated activity is identified in the pH region close to the value of pKa of the pyridinium cation. The onset of the ORR is therefore determined by the activity of different sites as a function of pH and evidence for distinct reduction reaction pathways emerges from these results.},

  abstract = {Abnormal levels of the neurotransmitter dopamine have been linked to a variety of neurochemical disorders including depression and Parkinson's disease. Dopamine concentrations are often quantified electrochemically using biosensors prepared from carbon electrode materials such as carbon paste or glassy carbon. The charge transfer kinetics of dopamine is highly sensitive to carbon surface termination, including the presence of certain oxygen functional groups and adsorption sites. However, the nature of the binding sites and the effects of surface oxidation on the voltammetry of dopamine are both poorly understood. In this work the electrochemical response of dopamine at glassy carbon model surfaces was investigated to understand the effects of altering both the carbon nanostructure and oxygen surface chemistry on dopamine charge transfer kinetics and adsorption. Glassy carbon electrodes with low oxygen content and a high degree of surface graphitisation were prepared via thermal annealing at 900\,°C, whilst highly oxidised glassy carbon electrodes were obtained through electrochemical anodisation at 1.8\,V vs Ag/AgCl. The carbon surface structure and composition in each case was studied via X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy. Voltammetry in solutions of dopamine at acidic pH confirmed that both annealing and anodisation treatments result in carbon surfaces with rapid charge transfer kinetics. However, dopamine adsorption occurs only at the low-oxygen, highly-graphitized carbon surface. Density functional theory studies on graphene model surfaces reveal that this behaviour is due to non-covalent interactions between the π-system of dopamine and the basal sites in the annealed surface. Simulations also show that the introduction of oxygen moieties disrupt these interactions and inhibit dopamine adsorption, in agreement with experiments. The results clarify the role of oxygen moieties and basal plane sites in facilitating both the adsorption of and charge transfer to DA at carbon electrodes.},

  abstract = {Abstract Metal-free carbon electrodes with well-defined composition and smooth topography are prepared via sputter deposition followed by thermal treatment with inert and reactive gases. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Raman spectroscopy show that three carbons of similar N/C content that differ in N-site composition are thus prepared: an electrode consisting of almost exclusively graphitic-N (NG), an electrode with predominantly pyridinic-N (NP), and one with ≈1:1 NG:NP composition. These materials are used as model systems to investigate the activity of N-doped carbons in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) using voltammetry. Results show that selectivity toward 4e-reduction of O2 is strongly influenced by the NG/NP site composition, with the material possessing nearly uniform NG/NP composition being the only one yielding a 4e-reduction. Computational studies on model graphene clusters are carried out to elucidate the effect of N-site homogeneity on the reaction pathway. Calculations show that for pure NG-doping or NP-doping of model graphene clusters, adsorption of hydroperoxide and hydroperoxyl radical intermediates, respectively, is weak, thus favoring desorption prior to complete 4e-reduction to hydroxide. Clusters with mixed NG/NP sites display synergistic effects, suggesting that co-presence of these sites improves activity and selectivity by achieving high theoretical reduction potentials while facilitating retention of intermediates.},

  abstract = {Grafting of aryldiazonium cations bearing a p-mannoside functionality over microbial fuel cell (MFC) anode materials was performed to investigate the ability of aryl-glycoside layers to regulate colonisation by biocatalytic biofilms. Covalent attachment was achieved via spontaneous reactions and via electrochemically-assisted grafting using potential step experiments. The effect of different functionalisation protocols on MFC performance is discussed in terms of changes in wettability, roughness and electrochemical response of modified electrodes. Water contact angle measurements (WCA) show that aryl-mannoside grafting yields a significant increase in hydrophilic character. Surface roughness determinations via atomic force microscopy (AFM) suggest a more disordered glycan adlayer when electrografting is used to facilitate chemisorption. MFCs were used as living sensors to successfully test the coated electrodes: the response of the MFCs in terms of start-up time was accelerated when compared to that of MFC equipped with non-modified electrodes, this suggests a faster development of a mature biofilm community resulting from aryldiazonium modifications, as confirmed by cyclic voltammetry of MFC anodes. These results therefore indicate that modification with glycans offers a bioinspired route to accelerating biofilm colonisation without any adverse effects on final MFC outputs.},
