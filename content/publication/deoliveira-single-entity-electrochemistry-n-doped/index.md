abstract: 'N-doped graphene oxides (GO) are nanomaterials of interest as building
  blocks for 3D electrode architectures for vanadium redox flow battery applications.
  N- and O-functionalities have been reported to increase charge transfer rates for
  vanadium redox couples. However, GO synthesis typically yields heterogeneous nanomaterials,
  making it challenging to understand whether the electrochemical activity of conventional
  GO electrodes results from a sub-population of GO entities or sub-domains. Herein,
  single-entity voltammetry studies of vanadyl oxidation at N-doped GO using scanning
  electrochemical cell microscopy (SECCM) are reported. The electrochemical response
  is mapped at sub-domains within isolated flakes and found to display significant
  heterogeneity: small active sites are interspersed between relatively large inert
  sub-domains. Correlative Raman-SECCM analysis suggests that defect densities are
  not useful predictors of activity, while the specific chemical nature of defects
  might be a more important factor for understanding oxidation rates. Finite element
  simulations of the electrochemical response suggest that active sub-domains/sites
  are smaller than the mean inter-defect distance estimated from Raman spectra but
  can display very fast heterogeneous rate constants $>$1 cm s-1. These results indicate
  that N-doped GO electrodes can deliver on intrinsic activity requirements set out
  for the viable performance of vanadium redox flow battery devices.'
