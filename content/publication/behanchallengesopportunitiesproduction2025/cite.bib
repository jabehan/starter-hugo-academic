    abstract = {Redox flow batteries (RFB) are promising devices for scalable and low-cost energy storage and conversion. Aqueous organic redox flow batteries (AORFBs) employ organic molecules including quinones, flavins and phenazines as active species due to their chemical tuneability, low toxicity and water solubility. However, typical synthetic routes to these molecules involve multiple reaction steps using expensive catalysts and organic solvents, adding significant costs and environmental impact. Organic active species (or redox mediators) with physico-chemical properties similar to synthetic AORFB active species are also ubiquitous in biology, raising the possibility of sustainable biosynthetic strategies for their production. In this perspective we highlight recent progress in the biosynthesis of aqueous organic redox mediators and address challenges for their viable application in AORFBs. We discuss redox mediator secretion by electroactive microorganisms in bioelectrochemical systems as a route to produce AORFB mediators from CO2 and organic waste streams. The unique advantages of applying electroactive microorganisms for mediator biosynthesis are highlighted, while challenges related to scalability, concentration, and stability are addressed. Moreover, we propose Direct coupling of bioelectrochemical/AORFB systems as a single autonomous, hybrid system. Finally, we outline technical, economic and environmental indicators to assess biosynthesised redox mediator applicability in future battery technology.},
