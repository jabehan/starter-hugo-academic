26 September 2022 - **XVIIth Colloquium of the Groupe
Français de Bioelectrochimie, Saint-Dié-des-Vosges,** «Tailoring
Carbon Nanomaterial Interfaces for Electrochemical applications
in Catalysis, Electroanalysis and Microbial Fuel Cells» Behan,
J.A.* Myles, A.; Ianacci, A., Barrière, F.; Colavita, P.E.



I participated in my first conference dedicated specifically to bioelectrochemistry. This was a very relaxed and friendly conference filled with many interesting talks across the breadth of the bioelectrochemistry field. It was fascinating to see how electrochemists have stepped up to tackle the pandemic with rapid electrochemical covid tests, and I was particularly impressed by the developments of some groups in the area of living engineered materials. My talk was a mish-mash of carbon nanomaterials, interfaces and my current work on microbial fuel cells. A highly insightful and rewarding experience.
