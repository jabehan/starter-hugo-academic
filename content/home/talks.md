I was invited to give a talk on the use of the **Differential Centrifugal Sedimentation** technique for nanoparticle sizing at the **CHEMICY Workshop** at the Ecole Nationale Superieur de Rennes on the 27/11/2024. 

Great discussions were had in the follow up with colleagues in diverse areas from ice chemistry to geology. I am hoping to introduce this technique to a lot of colleagues in the coming months - stay tuned!

*"Environmental and depollution applications of electroactive bacteria: from denitrification to iron bioremediation"*
**September 2024: Invited Webinar for the ["French Group of Bioelectrochemistry"](https://www.bioelectrochimie.fr/)**

It was an honor to present our recent work in various applications of electroactive bacteria in applied environmental applications to the Groupe Francaise de Bio√©lectrochimie. In this invited talk I discussed our recent publications in Bioelectrochemistry on the topics of applying electroactive bacteria in polluted environments.

*["Tailored Carbon Nanomaterial Interfaces for Electrocatalysis, Electroanalysis and Microbial Fuel Cell Applications"](https://www.european-mrs.com/advanced-carbon-materials-emrs#collapse68)*
**European Materials Research Society (EMRS) Spring Meeting 2022**

I was delighted to present our work at EMRS for the first time post-pandemic. The symposium was replete with very interesting presentations on carbon nanomaterials and our small section on biological applications generated a lot of discussion despite being the afternoon session towards the end of the programme. I came away feeling up to date on nanocarbons and energised to try all sorts of new experiments in the lab - exactly what you want from a world class international conference!
